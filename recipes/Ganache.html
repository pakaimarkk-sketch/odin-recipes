    <p>Ganache is a mixture of cream, or butter, and chocolate. Ganache can be made thick enough to use as a truffle filling or thin enough to use as a glaze. A 'thin' ganache can be melted to use as a glaze or whipped, and used as a filling for cakes. Use the best quality chocolate you can find.</p>
